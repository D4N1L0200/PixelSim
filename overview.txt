Previous_Buffer (Screen class -> Cell grid) = Previous state of cells
Next_Buffer (Screen class -> Update list) = Buffer to hold cells that will update next iteration
Out_Buffer (Screen class -> Cell grid) = Current state of cells to be displayed

Basic loop:
    For each cell in the Previous_Buffer:
        If cell is active:
            Check actions with neighboring cells
            Add updates to neighboring cells to Next_Buffer
            Update current cell to Out_Buffer
    Display Out_Buffer
